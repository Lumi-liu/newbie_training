				EARLY
	Today is Tuesday and the weather is cloudy. It 
is the second day to work for me. 
	Today I get up early and I go to work with walking.
I do not know the reason why some people want to get up 
later. If we get up early, we can have the opportunity 
to enjoy the fresh air and exercise of the morning. But 
they will have not. This is indeed a quite regrettable 
thing.To get up early is a good habit that we can do 
something wo want to do. At that time, it is also good 
to our health. Do not we do like this?
