			REPORT
    Today is Wednesday and it is a rainy day.
    That must be the story of innumerable couples,and the 
pattern of lifeof life it offers has a homely grace. It reminds 
you of a placid rivulet, meandering smoohtly through green 
pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls 
into the vasty sea; but the sea is so calm, so silent, so 
infifferent, that you are troubled suddently by a vague 
uneasiness.Perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature, strong 
in me even in those days, that i felt in such an existence, 
the share of the great majority, something amiss.
