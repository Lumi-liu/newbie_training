    Today is Thursday and it is a sunny day.
    Today I watch the sort algorithm including bubble sort, 
quick sort, selection sort and so on. I try to understand 
the structure of the algorithm and logic structure. And I 
compile the android file downloaded yesterday. But there is 
a mistake about JDK. After that I configure the JDK. And in 
the end they have solved with the help of others.
