    Today is Tuesday and  it is a sunny and cold day. 
But it is no wind.
    Today I do two experiments of yesterday. But the 
difference is that today I connect diagram with looking 
at the program code. And I try to modify code and 
configure pin code. I search some of the relevant 
knowledge to understand the meaning and the role them 
play of the pull-up resistor, the pull-down resistor 
and the current limiting resistor. I learn how to identify 
the color ring resistance and understanding use of the library 
function as well as millis().
