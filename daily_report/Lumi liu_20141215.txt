    Today is Monday and  it is a cloudy day.
    Today I try to modify the program of Character 
Device Driver with ioctl(). There is a small problem 
with result. The application cannot operate normally. 
It can run when the minor device number only is zero. 
I do not know why the result likes this. After that I 
also try to do the insertion sort algorithm and generate 
N random numbers between 0 and 10000000.
