			REPORT
    Today is Thursday and it is a cloudy day.
    However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not 
shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are.
It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will 
find faults in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You 
may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, 
even in a poor-house. The setting sun is reflected from the 
windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the rich man's 
abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring.
