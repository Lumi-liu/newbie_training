    Today is Wednesday and it is a cloudy day.
    Today I solve some problems left two days ago. The 
TC70-release has not been compiled through. There were a lot 
of mistakes about it. Then I asked my colleagues to help. But 
there were many other mistakes with 'testkey.x509.pem' about 
it after they has carried on the system configuration. I also 
try to do it many times. In addition to my computer run slowly 
with compiling about TC70-release. Sometimes the computer was 
dead. Finally I had to download the TC70-THD version and compile 
it. THen I also try to search some blogs on internet about how 
to compile the driver under Android system. I will try to compile
the TC70-release when I am off duty today and see it tomorrow if 
there is a mistake.
