			REPORT
    Today is Thursday and it is a sunny day.
    Today I revise the PPT file. And I add some contents 
about ioctl() and the information of the program verification. 
At that time I study the program codes and do exercises again. 
Then I edit screenshot and save a picture. I will make a report 
about the character device driver and that I have learned in 
this period of time next week. I also reviewe some knowledge 
about it. I will try to be able to understand a little more 
about it so that I can explain it to others syllabify.
