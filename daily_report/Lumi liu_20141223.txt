			REPORT
    Today is Tuesday and it is a sunny day.
    Today I read the book named Linux Device Driver of 
the timer and the delaying operation. I have a little 
unsuspectingly after I read it. There are some places 
that I do not understand. At that time I also try to 
search related information on the internet. And I read 
the part of codes and try to link up with the points of 
knowledge in the book.
