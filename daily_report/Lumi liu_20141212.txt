			REPORT
    Today is Friday and  it is a sunny day.
    Today I make a PPT file. And I find some of the 
information about the Character Device Driver in the 
books and on internet. When I do it I encounter some 
of problems. For example,How do I organize the content 
of each module, and how do I sort each module.At the 
same time it is helpful for me to call what I learned 
some time ago.
