    Today is Tuesday and it is a rainy day.
    In front of the person you love, your heart beats faster, 
but in front of the person you like, you get happy. If front of 
the person you love, you can’t say everything on your mind, but in 
front of the person you like, you can. In front of the person 
you love, you tend to get shy, but in front of the person you 
like, you can show your own self. You can’t look straight into 
the eyes of the one you love, but you can always smile into the 
eyes of the one you like. When the one you love is crying, you 
cry with him, but when the one you like is crying, you end up 
comforting. The feeling of love starts from the eye, and the 
feeling of like starts from the ears. So if you stop liking a 
person you used to like, all you need to do is cover your ears. 
But if you try to close your eyes, love turns into a teardrop 
and remains in your heart forever after.
