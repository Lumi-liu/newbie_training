    Today is Monday and it is a sunny day.
    Today I do two exercises. The one of it is a 
concurrency control and the other one is blocking or 
unblock I/O in Linux device driver. I start to view 
the related books and record some important concepts 
and matters needing attention inside it. After that I 
try to compile codes and debug it. And I verify it. I 
find the sixth exercise is not this when I am going to 
look at the polling operation with linux device driver. 
But today I have no time to look at the sixth exercise 
with the timer,delay or delay operation. I just look a 
little related knowledge about it. The codes are not
written. I will do it tomorrow.
