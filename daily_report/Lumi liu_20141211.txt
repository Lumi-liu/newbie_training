    Today is Thursday and  it is a cloudy day.
    Today I find some of the information about the Character 
Device Driver in the books and on internet. I begin to make a 
PPT file. When I do it I encounter some of problems. For example, 
what do capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) function and the parameter inside 
it mean? and when or where is it be used? At the same time it is 
helpful for me to call what I learned some time ago.
