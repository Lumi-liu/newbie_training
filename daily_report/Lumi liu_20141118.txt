    Today is Tuesday and the weather is nice.
    All of us ought to be able to brace ourselves 
for the predictable challenges and setbacks that 
crop up everyday. If we expect that life won’t be 
perfect, we’ll be able to avoid that impulse to quit. 
But even if you are strong enough to persist the 
obstacle course of life and work, sometimes you will 
encounter an adverse event that will completely knock 
you on your back.
