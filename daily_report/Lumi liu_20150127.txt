    Today is Tuesday and it is a cloudy day.
    What would you do if you failed? Many people may choose to 
give up. However, the surest way to success is to keep your 
direction and stick to your goal. On your way to success, you 
must keep your direction. It is just like a lamp, guiding you 
in darkness and helping you overcome obstacles on your way. 
Otherwise, you will easily get lost or hesitate to go ahead. 
Direction means objectives. You can get nowhere without an 
objective in life. You can try to write your objective on paper 
and make some plans to achieve it. In this way, you will know 
how to arrange your time and to spend your time properly. And 
you should also have a belief that you are sure to succeed as 
long as you keep your direction all the time.
