    Today is Wednesday and today is a sunny day. 
    Today I learn a simple Character Device Drivers about Miscdevice. And I try to write the program code about it. 
But there are a lot of mistakes and warning informations 
when I execute 'make'. After that I try to search some of 
the relevant knowledge with books and internet to solve it. 
Although it is hard to understand, I will try my best to 
do it.
