			REPORT
    Today is Monday and it is a sunny day.
    In theory, the pointer of the kernel space can use 
directly the pointer of user space. And it can also use 
the memcpy().In fact, on the architecture of no MMU, 
copy_form_user() is  implemed by using of memcpy(). But 
for the majority of MMU platform, the pointer of user 
space was passed in the virtual address space of the 
virtual address space. It points to the likely haven't 
really mapped to physical page. It Will lead to abnormal 
missing pages transparent by the kernel to be repaired. 
The directive will continue to run as if what have happened.
