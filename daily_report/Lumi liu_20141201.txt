    Today is Momday and the it is a sunny day. But 
it is cold today.
    Today I am familiar with arduino and its development 
environment. At that time I search some of the relevant 
knowledge to understand and I try to do it by myself. 
I write the program code so that it can be verified and 
uploaded. The answer is OK. But I do not want to do it 
like this. Because we are only responsible for calling 
library function.
