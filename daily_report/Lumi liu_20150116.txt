			REPORT
    Today is Friday and it is a cloudy day.
    I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly 
there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The 
town's poor seem to me often to live the most independent 
lives of any. May be they are simply great enough to receive 
without misgiving. Most think that they are above being 
supported by the town; but it often happens that they are 
not above supporting themselves by dishonest means. which 
should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden 
herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself much to get new 
things, whether clothes or friends, Turn the old, return to 
them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and 
keep your thoughts.
