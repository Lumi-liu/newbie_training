    Today is Friday and it is a sunny day.
    Sleep is a part of a personâ€™s daily activity cycle. If 
you are an average sleeper, your sleep cycle is as follows. 
When you first drift off into slumber, your eyes will roll 
abouta bit, and your temperature will drop slightly, your 
muscles willrelax, and your breathing will slow and become 
quite regular. Your brain waves slow down a bit too, with 
the alpha rhythm of rather fast waves predominating for the 
first few minutes. This is called stage 1 sleep.
