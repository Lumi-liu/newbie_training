    Today is Thursday and  it is a cloudy and cold day.
	Today I do some experiments about the Arduino. I connect 
diagram with looking at the book. And I try to modify code 
and configure pin code. I search some of the relevant knowledge 
to understand the meaning of the library function. For example 
"analogWrite(), map(), attachInterrupt()" and so on, I try to 
understand the meaning and information transmited of the parameter 
in the function.
