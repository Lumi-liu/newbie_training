			REPORT
    Today is Thursday and it is a sunny day.
    At noon I look at the result of TC70-release compiled 
yesterday. After that I read the knowledge about race and 
concurrency. The afternoon I think I will start to make PPT 
file. But something changes my plans. I receive an email. 
Let me fill in the new assessment and report on the work. 
And I must submit them before January 13th. I have no time 
to write it. In addition to I will have a lot of classes 
with the new training next week.
