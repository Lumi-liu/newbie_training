    Today is Tuesday and it is a sunny day.
    In the noon today, our group has a meeting. I 
learned about proc and sys file system at the meeting. 
It is a great help to understand linux file system later. 
Today I try to write a program about insertion sort. I 
try to add a file function that input data and output data 
will be written to the file. The result is error as well 
bus error(core dumped) and segmetation fault(core dumped). 
It has not effectively solved why does it have such specific 
error. I also search the relevant information on the internet. 
But the information is too general.
