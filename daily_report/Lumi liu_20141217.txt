    Today is Wednesday and it is a sunny day.
    Today I look about the problem that the minor number 
encounter zero of tht character device driver. I try to 
modify the program code slightly. A small problem is solved 
which I am not find yesterday. But the application program 
is still not normal run. After that I also see some program 
codes about insertion sort algorithm. In the afternoon I try 
to configure the Local Gerrit Server with the help of others. 
And I download some files with android. Today I have a cold 
and headache. I will go back earlier today. And I must buy 
some medicine to eat and have a good rest at night. I hope 
that I will be better tomorrow.
