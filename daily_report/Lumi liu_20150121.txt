    Today is Wednesday and it is a sunny day.
    We are all in the position of the farmer. If we plant a good 
seed, we reap a good harvest. If our seed is poor and full of 
weeds, we reap a useless crop. If we plant nothing at all, we 
harvest nothing at all. 
    The past is gone and static. Nothing we can do will change it. 
The future is before us and 9)dynamic. Everything we do will affect 
it. Each day brings with it new 10)frontiers, in our homes and in 
our business, if we only recognize them. We are just at the beginning 
of the progress in every field of human endeavor.
