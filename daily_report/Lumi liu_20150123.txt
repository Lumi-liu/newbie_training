			REPORT
    Today is Friday and it is a sunny day.
    The lives of most men are determined by their enviroment. 
They accept the circumstances amid which fate has thrown them 
not only resignation but even with good will. They are like 
streetcars running contendedly on their rails and they despise 
the sprightly flitter that dashes in and out of the traffic 
and speeds so jauntily across the open country. I respct them, 
they are good citizens, good husbands and good fathers, and of 
course somebody has to pay the taxes, but I do not find them 
exciting.
