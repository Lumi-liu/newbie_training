			REPORT
    Today is Wednesday and it is a sunny day.
    Today I read the book named Linux Device Driver of the 
timer and the delaying operation. There are some places that 
I do not understand. At that time I also try to search related 
information on the internet. And I read the part of codes and 
try to link up with the points of knowledge in the book. Finally 
I try to write the codes about it. But there is a mistake with 
"error: implicit declaration of function ‘create_proc_read_entry’".
I also try to search related information about the error. But I 
have no way to solve it now.
