    Today is Wednesday and  it is a cloudy day.
    Today I look at that how the analog port turnning 
into digital port. At that time I also search relevant 
information on the internet. After that I try to complete 
the Character Device Driver with ioctl(). There is a little 
mistake about it. It don't display buffer data. After I try 
to do it according to the book named Linux Device Driver. 
Why do not it display buffer data on screen? I will do it 
tomorrow.
