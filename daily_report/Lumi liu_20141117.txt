		REPORT
    Today is Monday and the weather is cloudy.
    We all wish to be happy, so we should take 
good care of our health.
    Health is the best treasure which a man can 
possess. Money can do many things, but it cannot 
buy happiness. However, so long as man has good 
health, he can enjoy the pleasures of human life.
    In order to insure good health we must pay 
attention to three things. They are-nourishing 
food, fresh air and proper exercise.
