    Today is Monday and it is a sunny day.
    We convince ourselves that life will be better after we 
get married, have a baby. Then we are frustrated that the kids
aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After
that we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will
certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves 
that our life will be complete when we are able to go on a nice 
vacation, when we retire.
    The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. 
Your life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit 
this to yourself and decide to be happy. There is no way to happiness.
Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have.
