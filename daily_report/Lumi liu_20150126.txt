    Today is Monday and it is a cloudy day.
    We all have weaknesses and strengths – no matter who we 
are. Sometimes the weaknesses seem to outweigh the strengths 
and sometimes it's the other way around. Some people get sick 
easily. Some struggle to manage their finances properly. Some 
people are hopeless communicators and struggle with relationships. 
Many people leave it and that and accept it as just bad luck – but 
not everyone. Some people facing huge limitations still manage to 
achieve tremendous things. They rise above their weaknesses and 
do not allow them to limit their possibilities.
