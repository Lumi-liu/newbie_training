    Today is Friday and it is cloudy.
    Of course, being happy at work depends mostly on 
how much you like your job. But there are also smaller 
steps that can boost your happiness, as well. Some of 
these steps are VERY small, but the fact that you're 
taking steps to improve your situation itself boosts 
happiness. Check for eyestrain by putting your hand to 
your forehead in a salute. If your eyes feel relieved, 
your work space is too bright. Sit up straight with your 
shoulders down -- every time I adjust my sitting position, 
I instantly feel more energetic and cheerier.
