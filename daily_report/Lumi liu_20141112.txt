			REPORT
    Today is Wednesday and the weather is cloudy.
    Today I find time is a cruel thing. Whoever you 
are, time always goes on. It does not stay to wait for 
somebody. You can not use anything to exchange it. Time 
is also a fair thing. Although you have a lot of money 
or you enjoy high reputation, it does not leave them more. 
Today I find I have not enough time. And I find I have a 
lot of things about my job to do.
