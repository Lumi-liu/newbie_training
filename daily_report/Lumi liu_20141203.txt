				REPORT
    Today is Wednesday and  it is a cloudy and cold day.
    Today I am familiar with ioctl() of the character device 
driver. At that time I also try to solve the issues left last 
week. There will be a warning message "sysfs: cannot create 
duplicate filename '/devices/virtual/globalmem'", with using 
the 'dmesg' command when I insert the module again after I 
remove it. The equipment nodes have be existed under the '/dev' 
directory. Finally the problem has been solved. I try to add a 
line code in the program. And I exchange the position of them. 
There is no warning messages.
