    Today is Thursday and it is a cloudy day.
    Everyone needs friendship. No one can sail the ocean of life 
single-handed. We need help from, and also give help to, others. 
In modern society, people attach more importance to relations and 
connections. With friendship, life is happy and harmonious. Without 
friendship, life is sad and unfortunate. We all care for each other, 
love and help each other. We feel we are happiest when we chat and 
exchange ideas with one another. With my friends, I knowwhat to 
treasure, what to tolerate and what to share. I will never forget my 
old friends, and I'll keep making new friends. I will not be cold 
and indifferent to my poor friends, and I will show concern for them, 
even if it is only a comforting word.
