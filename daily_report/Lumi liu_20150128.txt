    Today is Wednesday and it is a cloudy day.
    One of the more pervasive and destructive mental tendencies 
I've seen is that of focusing on what we want instead of what we 
have. It doesn't seem to make my difference how much we have, we 
just keep expanding our list of desires, which guarantees we will 
remain dissatisfied. The mind-set that says "I'll be happy" when 
this desire is fulfilled is the same mind-set that will repeat 
itself once that desire is met.
