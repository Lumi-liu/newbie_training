    Today is Thursday and today is a sunny day. 
    Today I learn Character Device Drivers and I am familiar 
with linklist and structures of C language. At that time I 
search some of the relevant knowledge. And I try to write 
the program code about it. There is a little mistakes so that 
I do not finish it. But I never give up. I will try complete it.
