			REPORT
    Today is Wednesday and the weather is nice.
    However mean your life is, you need meet it and live 
it. You do not shun it or call it hard names. It is not 
so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. 
The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love 
your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant,
glorious hours, even in a poorhouse.
