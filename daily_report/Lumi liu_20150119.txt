			REPORT
    Today is Monday and it is a sunny day.
    I have not thought and have not done or felt enough-the 
early sun, rain and the seasonal delight of flocks of ducks 
and geese in flight, the mysteries of late-at-night. I still 
need time to read a book, write poems, paint a picture, look 
at scenes and faces dear to me. There is something more to be 
of value-something I should find within myself-as peace of mind, 
patience, grace and being kind. I shall take and I shall give, 
while yet, there is so much to live for-rainbows, stars that 
gleam, the fields, the hills, the hope, the dream the truth 
that one must seek. I"ll stay here-treasure every day and love 
the world in my own way!
