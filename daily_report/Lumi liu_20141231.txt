			REPORT
    Today is Wednesday and it is a cloudy day.
    Today I make a report at the meeting about the character 
device driver that I have learned in this period of time. I 
also reviewe some knowledge about it. I try to explain it to 
others syllabify. A question that the differece between 
compat_ioctl() and unlocked_ioctl() is raised at the meeting. 
I have seen a similar problem on the internet. But I was not 
too much understanding of the relevant problems. After that 
I try to search relevant information on internet about it. 
The afternoon I try my best to solve the problem left yesterday. 
But I have not. Finally the problem is solved with the help 
of my colleagues.
