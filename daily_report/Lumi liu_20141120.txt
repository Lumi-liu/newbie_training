    Today is Thursday and the weather is sunny.
    The food we eat seems to have a profound impact 
on our health. Although science has made enormous 
steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the 
same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research 
has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human 
illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of 
cancer is related to the diet as well.
