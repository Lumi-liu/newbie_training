			REPORT
    Today is Thursday and it is rain and snow.
    If your life feels like it is lacking the power that you want 
and the motivation that you need, sometimes all you have to do is 
shift your point of view. By training your thoughts to concentrate 
on the bright side of things, you are more likely to have the incentive
to follow through on your goals. Your life can be enhanced, and your 
happiness enriched, when you choose to change your perspective. Don't 
leave your future to chance, or wait for things to get better 
mysteriously on their own. You must go in the direction of your hopes 
and aspirations. Begin to build your confidence, and work through 
problems rather than avoid them.
