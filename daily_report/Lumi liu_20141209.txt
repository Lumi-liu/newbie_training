    Today is Tuesday and  it is a sunny day.
    Today I do experiment left last week. In addition to 
button control function is not complete, others have been 
solved. I try to use interrupt mode to solve the problem 
about button control. But the digital interface is not 
enough to use. I must try to turn the analog interface into 
the digital interface. But there is a few issues about LED 
light state if I do it like this. I will think carefully 
about this problem. After that I try to solve the Character 
Device Driver with ioctl(). The program can run.
