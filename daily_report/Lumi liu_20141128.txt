    Today is Friday and it is a sunny day. 
    Today I learn linklist and structures of C 
language. And I try to write the program code 
and debug it. But the answer is unsatisfactory 
for me. There are many features need to be improved. 
I will do it well. Today I am familiar with Device 
Drivers and application. Let them communicate via 
"ioctl". But I do not write the code. I will try to 
write it next week.
