    Today is Friday and  it is a sunny and cold day.
    Today I do experiment with eight segment digital controled 
by a IR Remote Controller. I try to add a few other functions 
on this experiment. For example, a reset circuit, two light 
emitting diodes with display, and the control buttons. I try to 
compile program code and connect the circuit. Finally, the 
program can run, but the result is that I do not want to achieve. 
The control with the button is not ready now. One button control 
can be OK, but two not. I will do it next week.
