    Today is Friday and it is a cloudy day.
    College students are more ambitious. Many of them are 
eager to compete in big cities like Shanghai and Beijing, 
where talents are abundant and positions are limited. Refusing 
to go back hometown let them suffer in big cities, which 
indirectly make their situation worse.Generally speaking, 
college students should be more qualified to better themselves 
and adjust their goals according to the reality.
